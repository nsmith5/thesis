Two improvements to the binary Structural Phase Field Crystal (XPFC) theory are
presented. The first is a general phenomenology for modelling density-density
correlation functions and the second extends the free energy of mixing term in
the binary XPFC model beyond ideal mixing to a regular solution model. These
improvements are applied to study kinetics of precipitation from solution. We
see a two-step nucleation pathway similar to recent experimental work
\cite{LOH17, WALLACE13} in which the solution first decomposes into solute-poor
and solute-rich regions followed by nucleation in the solute-rich regions.
Additionally, we find a phenomena not previously described in literature in
which the growth of precipitates is accelerated in the presence of
uncrystallized solute-rich regions.
