\label{chapter:cdft_intro}

Many physical theories are derived using a succession of approximations. The
utility of this approach is that, while each approximation yields a new theory
that is more narrow in scope, the subsequent theory is typically more tractible
to either analytical or numerical analysis.  Classical Density Functional
Theory (CDFT) is derived using this approach and in this chapter we'll examine
each approximation and the intermediate theory they supply. In the following
chapter, we'll see how CDFT can be used to examine the problem of
solidification and how we can derive a more simplified theory, the Phase Field
Crystal theory, from it.

CDFT is a theory of statistical mechanics. This means CDFT connects microscopic
physics to macroscopic observables using statistical
inference\footnote{Statistical mechanics is not always described as statistical
inference. See works of E. T. Jaynes for details on this approach
\cite{JAYNES57}} instead of attempting to compute microscopic equations of
motion. The microscopic physics in this case is most accurately described by
many-body quantum mechanics and so the theory of quantum statistical mechanics
is a natural starting point in any attempt to calculate thermodynamic
observables.

We will see that for our systems of interest that the full quantum statistical
theory is completely intractible. To preceed, we'll look at quantum statistical
mechanics in the \textit{semi-classical limit}. In the semi-classical limit
we'll develop a theory of inhomogenous fluids called Classical Density
Functional Theory (CDFT). Finally, we'll see that constructing exactly free
energy functionals for CDFT is rarely possible and look at an approximation
scheme for these functionals.

\section{Statistical Mechanics in the Semi-classical limit} %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Although the quantum statistical mechanics picture gives us a link between the
microscopic and macroscopic reality of thermodynamics systems, it still
contains too much detail.  For instance, the precise bosonic or fermionic
nature of the particles in the system often has little consequence on the
thermodynamic properties.  We can ignore some of these quantum mechanical
details by looking at statistical mechanics in the \textit{semi-classical
limit}.

For the sake of clarity, we'll look at a system of $N$ identical particles in
the canonical ensemble which is straight forward to generalize to
multi-component systems and other ensembles.  We start with the definition of
the partition function for a system of many particles,  
%
\begin{equation}
    Z = \trace{e^{-\beta\hat{H}}}, 
\end{equation} 
%
where, $\hat{H} = \f{\vert\p\vert^2}{2m} + V(\q)$ and $\p = (p_1, p_2, ...p_N)$
is the vector of particle momenta.  $\q$ is similarly defined for the particle
positions.  Wigner \cite{PhysRev.40.749},and, shortly after, Kirkwood
\cite{PhysRev.44.31} showed that the partition function could be expanded in
powers of $\hbar$, facilitating the calculation of both a classical limit and
quantum corrections to the partition function.  Their method, the
Wigner-Kirkwood expansion, involves evaluating the trace operation over a basis
of plane wave solutions,
%
\begin{equation}
    \Z(\beta) = \int \f{\mathrm{d}\q \mathrm{d}\p}{(2\pi \hbar)^N}
        e^{-\frac{i\p\cdot\q}{\hbar}} 
        e^{-\beta \hat{H}} e^{\frac{i\p\cdot\q}{\hbar}} 
        = \int d\Gamma I(\q, \p), 
\end{equation}
%
Where, $d\Gamma$ is the phase space measure
$\mathrm{d}\p\mathrm{d}\q/(2\pi\hbar)^N$.  To compute the integrand, $I(\q, \p)$,
we follow Uhlenbeck and Bethe \cite{Uhlenbeck1936729} and first compute its
derivative,
%
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial I(\q, \p)}{\partial \beta} = -\pwp\hat{H}\pwm I(\q, \p).
\end{equation}
%
If we then make a change of variables, $I(\q, \p) = e^{-\beta\ham}W(\q, \p)$, where
$\ham$ is the classical Hamiltonian, and use the explicit form of the quantum
Hamiltonian we arrive at a partial differential equation for $W$.
%
\begin{equation} 
    \f{\partial W}{\partial \beta} = \f{\hbar^2}{2} \l(
        \nabla_{\mathbf{q}}^2 
        - \beta(\nabla_\q^2V)
        + \beta^2(\nabla V)^2 
        - 2\beta(\nabla_\q V)\cdot\nabla_\q
        + 2 \frac{i}{\hbar}\p\cdot(\nabla_\q -\beta\nabla_\q) 
    \r)W(\q, \p) 
\end{equation}
%
The solution can be written as a power series in $\hbar$, $W = 1 + \hbar W_1 +
\hbar W_2 + ...$.  This creates a power series expansion for the partition
function as well,
%
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{Z} = (1 + \hbar \mean{W_1} + \hbar^2 \mean{W_2}+ ...)
        \int d\Gamma e^{\beta\ham}.
\end{equation}
%
Where the average, $\mean{\cdot}$, denotes the the classical average, 
%
\begin{equation} \langle A(p, q) \rangle = \frac{1}{\Z} \int d\Gamma A(p, q)
e^{-\beta \ham}.  \end{equation}
%
For the sake of brevity we'll quote solution to second order, but
details can be found in Landau and Lifshitz \cite{LANDAU198079}.
%
\begin{gather}
    \mean{W_1}= 0 \\
    \mean{W_2} = - \f{\beta^3}{24 m} \mean{\l\vert\nabla_\q V \r\vert^2}
\end{gather}
%
The first order term is zero, because $W_1(\q, \p)$ is an odd function of $\p$.
In terms of the Helmholtz free energy, for example, the corrections to second
order would be, 
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{quantumcorr}
    \mathcal{F} = \mathcal{F}_{classical} + \f{\hbar^2\beta^2}{24m}
        \mean{ \l\vert \nabla_\q V(\q) \r\vert^2 }.
\end{equation}

There are a few items of importance in equation \ref{quantumcorr}. First of all
the correction inversely proportional to both the temperature and the particle
mass.  For copper at room termperature, for instance, the prefactor
$\hbar^2\beta^2/(24 m)$ is $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$.  The correction is also
proportional to the mean of the squared force felt by each particle. So high
density materials will have a higher quantum correction because they sample the
short-range repulsive region of the pair potential more than their low density
counter parts.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Indistinguishability} %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

There is an important distinction to be made between the quantum theory and the
theory in the semi-classical limit.  The integral over phase space of the
partition function must only take into account the \textit{physically
different} states of the system.  In the quantum theory this is acheived by
tracing over any orthonormal basis of the Hilbert space, but in the classical
theory we need to be careful not to double count states when identical
particles are in the theory.  Exchange of two identical particles does not
result in a physically different state and thus this state should only be
considered only once in the sum over states in the partition function.  More
precisely, we should write the classical partition function as,
%
\begin{equation} \Z = \int^\prime d\Gamma e^{-\beta \ham}, \end{equation}
%
Where the primed integral denotes integration only over the physically distinct
states. In the common case of $N$ identical particles, the phase space integral
becomes, 
%
\begin{equation} \int^\prime d\Gamma \rightarrow \f{1}{N!}\int d\Gamma
\end{equation}
%
Aggregating our results, we can write the partition function in the
semi-classical limit as,
%
\begin{equation}
    \Z(\beta) = \frac{1}{N!}\int d\Gamma e^{-\beta \ham} + \mathcal{O}(\hbar ^ 2),
\end{equation}
%
Or, in the grand canonical ensemble,
%
\begin{equation} 
    \Xi(\mu, \beta) = \sum_{N = 0}^\infty \f{e^{\beta\mu N}}{N!}
        \int d\Gamma \l( e^{-\beta \ham} + \mathcal{O}(\hbar^2)\r)
\end{equation}

Of course, to first order in $\hbar$, this is exactly the form taught in
introductory courses on statistical mechanics and derived by Gibbs\footnote{The
$\hbar$ in Gibbs' formula was justified on dimensional grounds and was simply a
scaling factor with units of action ($J\cdot s$)} prior to any knowledge of
quantum mechanics \cite{Gibbs}.  The key insight here is to understand, in a
contolled way, when this approximation is accurate and the magnitude of the next
quantum correction is as seen in equation \ref{quantumcorr}.

\section{Classical Density Functional Theory}  %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Ostensibly, when we study formation and evolution of microstructure in solids,
our observable of interest is the density field.  As per usual in theories of
statistical thermodynamics we must distinguish between microscopic operators
and macroscopic observables (the later being the ensemble average of the
former).  In classical statistical mechanics, operators are simply functions
over the phase space, $\Gamma$.  We use the term operator to make connection
with the quantum mechanical theory.  In the case of the density field, the
microscopic operator is the sum of Dirac delta functions at the position of each
particle,
%
\begin{equation} 
    \hat{\rho}(x; \q) = \sum_{i = 0}^N \d^{(3)}\l(x - q_i\r)
\end{equation}
%
From which the thermodynamic observable is, 
%
\begin{equation} 
    \label{mean_density} 
    \rho(x) = \mean{\hat{\rho}(x; \q)} = 
        \trace{\hat{\rho}(x; \q) f(\q, \p)}
\end{equation}
%
Where, $\trace{\cdot}$ denotes the classical trace\footnote{The classical trace
in the grand canonical example in this particular case},
%
\begin{equation}
    \trace{A(\q, \p) f(\q, \p)} = \sum_{N =0}^\infty
        \f{1}{N!}\int\mathrm{d}\Gamma A(\q, \p) f(\q, \p), 
\end{equation}
%
And, $f(\q, \p)$ is the probability density function,
%
\begin{equation} 
    f(\q, \p) = \f{e^{-\beta (\ham - \mu N)}}{\Xi(\mu, \beta)}.
\end{equation}
%

To construct a theory of the density field we review the usual methodology for
statistical thermodynamics. We will do so in the frame of entropy maximization
in which the entropy is maximized subject to the macroscopically available
information. Taking the existance of a average of the density field, particle
number and energy as the macroscopically available information, we can maximize
the entropy functional,
%
\begin{equation}
    S[f(\q, \p)] = -k_b \trace{f(\q, \p)\ln\l(f(\q, \p)\r)}, 
\end{equation}
%
subject to the aforementioned contraints to find a probability density function
of the form,
%
\begin{equation} 
    f(\q, \p) \propto \exp\l(-\beta(\ham -\mu N + \int \mathrm{d}x
        \phi(x)\hat{\rho}(x)\r).
\end{equation}
%
Where, $\beta$, $\mu$ and $\phi(x)$ are the Lagrange multipliers associated
with constraints of average energy, number of particles and density
respectively. As you might imagine, the constraints of average particle number
and density are not independent and with the insight that,
%
\begin{equation}
    N = \int dx \hat{\rho}(x),
\end{equation}
%
We can combine their Lagrange multipliers into one,
%
\begin{equation}
    f(\q, \p) \propto \exp\l(- \beta(\ham - \int \mathrm{d}x \psi(x)
        \hat{\rho}(x))\r),
\end{equation}
%
Where, $\psi(x) = \mu - \phi(x)$, is the combined Langrange multiplier named
the \textit{intrinsic chemical potential}. Recalling that chemical potential is
the change Helmholtz free energy made by virtue of adding particles to the
system,
%
\begin{equation}
    \f{\partial F}{\partial N} = \mu,
\end{equation}
%
The interpretation of the intrinsic chemical potential follows as the Helmholtz
free energy change due to particles being added to a specific location.  We'll
see this in more detail briefly.  Now, as with all statistical mechanics
theories, the challenge to is to compute the moment generating function
(partition function) or equivalently the cumulant generating function (free
energy) so as to compute the statistics of our observable of choice.  In case
of observables of the density field, this is made somewhat more technical by
the fact that the density is an entire function instead of a scalar variable.
As such the partition function is more precisely called the partition
\textit{functional} and the free energy function is more precisely called the
free energy \textit{functional}.  Specifically, the grand canonical partition
functional is,
%
\begin{equation}
    \Xi[\psi(x)] = \trace{\exp\l(-\beta\ham +\beta\int\mathrm{d}x
        \psi(x) \hat{\rho}(x)\r)}.
\end{equation}
%
As eluded to above, the partition function is a type of moment generating
functional in that repeated functional differentiation yields moments of the
density field:
%
\begin{equation}
    \f{\beta^{-n}}{\Xi} \f{\d^n \Xi[\psi]}{\d \psi(x_1) \dots \d\psi(x_n)} 
        = \mean{\hat{\rho}(x_1)\dots\hat{\rho}(x_n)}.
\end{equation}
%
Similarly, we can construct a free enery functional by taking the logarithm of
the partition function. This free energy functional in particular is called the
\textit{grand potential functional}.
%
\begin{equation}
    \Omega[\psi(x)] = -k_bT\log\l(\Xi[\psi(r)]\r)
\end{equation}
%
The grand potential functional is a type of cumulant generating functional in
the sense that repeated functional differentiation yields cumulants of the
density field:
%
\begin{equation}
    -\f{\beta^{-n + 1}\d^n\Omega[\psi]}{\d\psi(x_1)\dots\d\psi(x_n)}
        = \mean{\hat{\rho}(x_1)\dots\hat{\rho}(x_n)}_c
\end{equation}
%
Where, $\langle A^1\dots A^n \rangle_c$, denotes the n-variable joint
cumuluant.

If we examine the first two cumulants,
%
\begin{gather}
    \label{mean_rho}
    - \f{\d \Omega[\psi]}{\d \psi(x)}
        = \mean{\hat{\rho}(x)} \equiv \rho(x), \\
    \label{var_rho} 
    -k_b T\f{\d^2 \Omega[\psi]}{\d \psi(x) \d \psi(x^\prime)}
        = \mean{(\hat{\rho}(x) - \rho(x))
          (\hat{\rho}(x^\prime) - \rho(x^\prime))},
\end{gather}
%
We notice something remarkable: The first, implies that the average density field is a function of only its conjugate
field, the intrinsic chemical potential, and the second implies that that
relationship is invertible\footnote{The inverse function theorem only implies
local invertibility, there is no guarentee of global invertibility. Indeed
phase coexistance is a manifestation of this fact where a single intrinsic
chemical potential is shared by two phases}.  To see this, we compute the 
Jacobian by combining equation \ref{mean_rho} and \ref{var_rho},
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{jacobian}
    \f{\d \rho(x)}{\d \psi(x^\prime)} 
        = \beta \mean{(\hat{\rho}(x) - \rho(x))
        (\hat{\rho}(x^\prime) - \rho(x^\prime))}.
\end{equation}
%
The right hand side of equation \ref{jacobian} is an autocorrelation function
and therefore positive semi-definite by Weiner-Khinchin theorem. This implies that, 
at least locally, the intrinsic chemical potential can always be written as a functional
of the average density, $\psi[\rho(x)]$, and vice versa. Furthermore, because
all of the higher order cumulants of the density depend on the intrinsic chemical
potential, they too depend only on the average density.

Given the importance of the average density, $\rho(x)$, if follows that we would
like to use a thermodynamic potential with a natural dependence on the density. We can
construct a generalization of the Helmholtz free energy that has precisely this 
characteristic by Legendre transforming the Grand potential,
%
\begin{equation}
    \F[\rho(x)] = \Omega[\psi[\rho]] + \int dx \rho(x) \psi(x).
\end{equation}
%

$\F[\rho(x)]$ is called the \textit{intrinsic free energy functional}.

It can be shown \cite{HansenAppendixB} that $\rho(x)$ must be the global
minimum of the grand potential, which sets the stage for the methodology of
classical density functional theory: if we have a defined intrinsic free energy
functional, $\F$, we can find the equilibrium density field by solving the
asssociated Euler-Lagrange equation, 
%
\begin{equation}
    \f{\d \Omega[\rho]}{\d \rho(r)} = 0.
\end{equation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Techniques in Density Functional Theory} %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The difficulty in formulating a density functional theory is the construction
of an appropriate free energy functional.  While exact calculations are rarely
feasible, there are a variety of techniques that help in building approximate
functionals.  Its important to note first what we \textit{can} compute exactly.
In the case of the ideal gas, we can compute the grand potential and free
energy functional exactly,
%
\begin{gather}
    \Omega_{id}[\psi] = -\f{k_bT}{\Lambda^{3}} 
        \int\mathrm{d}x\,e^{\beta\psi(x)} \\ 
    \F_{id}[\rho] = k_bT\int \mathrm{d}x
        \l\lbrace \rho(x) \ln\l(\Lambda^3\rho(x)\r) - \rho(x) \r\rbrace,
    \label{F_ideal}
\end{gather}
% 
Where $\Lambda$ is the thermal de Broglie wavelength,
%
\begin{equation}
    \Lambda = \sqrt{\f{h^2}{2\pi mk_bT}}.
\end{equation}
%
We may then express a deviations from ideality by factoring the ideal
contribution out of the partition function,
%
\begin{equation}
    \Xi[\psi] = \Xi_{id}[\psi]\Xi_{ex}[\psi],
\end{equation}
%
leading to grand potential and free energy functionals split into ideal and
\textit{excess} components,
%
\begin{gather}
    \Omega = \Omega_{id} + \Omega_{ex} \\
    \F = \F_{id} + \F_{ex}.
\end{gather}

The interaction potential, $V(\q)$, in the excess partition function typically
makes a direct approach to calculating the excess free energy intractible.
Though perturbative methods, including the cluster expansion technique
\cite{MAYER41}, have been developed to treat the interaction potential
systematically, other approximation schemes for the excess free energy are
typically more pragmatic.  In particular, we can approximate the excess free
energy by expanding around a reference homogeneos fluid with chemical potential
$\mu_0$ and density $\rho_0$,
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{fex_expansion}
    \F_{ex}[\rho] = \F_{ex}[\rho_0]
        + \l . \f{\d \F_{ex}}{\d\rho(x)} \r\vert_{\rho_0} \ast \Delta\rho(x) 
        + \f{1}{2} \Delta\rho(x^\prime) \ast
            \l . \f{\d^2 \F_{ex}}{\d\rho(x)\d\rho(x^\prime)}
            \r\vert_{\rho_0} \ast \Delta\rho(x) 
        + \dots,
\end{equation}
%
Where $\Delta\rho(x) = \rho(x) - \rho_0$ and we have introduced the notation,
$\ast$ to mean integration over repeated co-ordinates,
%
\begin{equation}
    f(x^\prime) \ast g(x^\prime)
        \equiv \int\mathrm{d}x^\prime f(x^\prime) g(x^\prime).
\end{equation}
%
The excess free energy is the generating functional of family of correlation
functions called \textit{direct correlation functions}, 
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{direct_correlation}
    \f{\d^n \F_{ex}[\rho]}{\d \rho(x_1) ... \d \rho(x_n)}
        = -\beta C^{n}(x_1, \dots, x_n).
\end{equation}
%
The first of which, for a uniform fluid, is the excess contribution to the
chemical potential which we may express as the total chemical potential less
the ideal contribution, 
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{mu_ex}
    \left.\f{\d F_{ex}}{\d \rho}\right\vert_{\rho_0}
        = \mu_0^{ex}
        = \mu_0 - \mu_{id} 
        = \mu_0 - k_bT\ln\left(\Lambda^3 \rho_0\right).
\end{equation}
%
Should we truncate the expansion in equation \ref{fex_expansion} to second
order in $\Delta\rho(x)$ and substitute the linear and quadratic terms with
equation \ref{mu_ex} and \ref{direct_correlation} we can simplify the excess
free energy to,
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{F_ex}
    \F_{ex}[\rho(r)] = \F_{ex}[\rho_0] 
        + \int dr 
            \l\lbrace\mu - k_bT \ln\l(\Lambda^3 \rho_0 \r)
            \r\rbrace \Delta\rho(r)
        - \f{k_b T}{2} \Delta\rho(r) \ast C^{(2)}_0(r, r^\prime) 
            \ast \Delta\rho(r^\prime)
\end{equation}
%
Combining equation \ref{F_ideal} with the simplified excess free energy in
equation \ref{F_ex}, we can express total change in free energy, $\Delta \F =
\F - \F[\rho_0]$, as,
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{cdft_free_energy}
    \Delta \F [\rho(r)] 
        = k_b T\int \mathrm{d}r 
            \l\lbrace \rho(r) \ln\l(\f{\rho(r)}{\rho_0} \r) 
            - (1-\beta\mu_0) \Delta \rho(r)\r\rbrace 
        - \f{k_b T}{2}\Delta \rho(r) \ast C_0^{(2)}(r, r^\prime) 
            \ast \Delta \rho(r^\prime).
\end{equation}
%
We find an equivalent expression for the grand potential after a Legendre
transform,
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{cdft_grand_potential}
    \Delta \Omega [\rho(r)]
        = k_b T\int \mathrm{d}r 
            \l\lbrace \rho(r) \l[\ln\l(\f{\rho(r)}{\rho_0} \r) 
            + \beta\phi(r) \r] -  \Delta \rho(r)\r\rbrace 
        - \f{k_b T}{2}\Delta \rho(r) \ast C_0^{(2)}(r, r^\prime) 
            \ast \Delta \rho(r^\prime).
\end{equation}


Its reasonable to ask at this point whether or not we have really gained
anything with this approximation scheme.  Although we have arrived at a
relatively simple form for the free energy functional, we've added a lot of
parameters to the functional based on the reference fluid.  Thankfully, the
theory of homogeneous liquids, such as our reference liquid, is very well
established.  This means we may relay on a broad choice of analytical,
numerical or experimental techniques to derive these parameters.

Equation \ref{cdft_free_energy} establishes an approximate density functional
theory for inhomogenous fluids and, as we will see in the following chapter,
for the seemingly disparate phenonmena of solidification. We see that it can
derived through a series of approximations from a fundamental basis in quantum
statistical mechanics and requires no more parameters than the thermodynamic
details of a homogeneous reference fluid.
