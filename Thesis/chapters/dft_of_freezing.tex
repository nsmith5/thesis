The classical density functional theories derived in chapter \ref{fundamentals} was first established to study inhomogenous fluids.
Interestingly, one can think of the solid state as an especially extreme case of an inhomogeneous fluid \cite{HANSEN-CH6}.
In this case, we can use CDFT to study the circumstances under which the density field develops long range periodic solutions (ie., solidification).
While not expressed in precisely this language, this idea dates back as far as 1941 with the early work of Kirkwood and Monroe \cite{KIRKWOOD_MONROE41} and was later significantly refined by Youssof and Ramakrishnan \cite{RAMAKRISHNAN79}.
