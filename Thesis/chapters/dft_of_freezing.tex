\label{dft_of_freezing}

The classical density functional theories derived in chapter
\ref{fundamentals} was first established to study inhomogenous fluids.
Interestingly, one can think of the solid state as an especially extreme
case of an inhomogeneous fluid \cite{HANSEN-CH6}.  In this case, we can
use CDFT to study the circumstances under which the density field develops
long range periodic solutions (ie., solidification).  While not expressed
in precisely this language, this idea dates back as far as 1941 with the
early work of Kirkwood and Monroe \cite{KIRKWOOD_MONROE41} and was later
significantly refined by Youssof and Ramakrishnan \cite{RAMAKRISHNAN79}.

\section{Amplitude Expansions} %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

More precisely, if we would like to study the liquid-solid transitions we
can expand the density field in a set of plane-waves that span the unit
cell of the solid phase,
%
\begin{equation} \rho(\mathbf{x}) = \f{1}{V_{cell}} \sum_i \xi_i e^{i
\mathbf{k}_i \cdot \mathbf{x}}.  \end{equation}
%
In the solid phase, the amplitudes $\xi_i$ become nonzero for
$\mathbf{k}_i \ne 0$ and describe the periodic structure of the solid
density field.  In the liquid, only the $\mathbf{k}_i = 0$ value remains
(ie., the density becomes constant).  Since the density profile can be
reconstructed with knowledge of all the of amplitudes we can rewrite the
grand potential as a function of the amplitudes only, 
%
\begin{equation} \Omega[\rho(x)] = \Omega(\lbrace\xi_i\rbrace),
\end{equation}
%
From which the equilibrium condition becomes,
%
\begin{equation} \f{\partial \Omega(\lbrace\xi_i\rbrace)}{\partial \xi_k}
= 0, \,\,\forall \,k.  \end{equation}
%

Using this technique and the approximate free energy of Equation
\ref{cdft_free_energy} results in good agreement with experiment can be found
for equilibrium properties such as the density change of solidification.
{\color{ForestGreen} table of results from Ramakrishnan? } The implication of
these results and their success in predicting equilibrium thermodynamic
properties points a the amplitudes, $\xi_i$, as natural and appropriate order
parameters from the problem of solidification. 

In spite of these successes, CDFT has a major short coming in that it is an
equilibrium theory. This short coming cannot be understated in any attempt to
be a theory of the mechanical and thermodynamic properties of metal systems.
While some mechanical properties are well understood with an understanding of
the perfect crystalline state, such as the Young's modulus, the vast majority
of mechanical properties of solids is due to their microstructural defects.

Artifacts such as grains boundaries, dislocations and vacancies play key roles
not only in the mechanical properties but also the kinetic pathways of certain
phase transformations. For instance, dislocations can act to catalyze
precipication in binary alloys [cite Vahid].

The problem that we face is then, how do we examine these defects and
microstructural elements but retain some of the positive aspects of CDFT? More
specifically, what path does density profile take to equilibrium?

\section{Dynamic Density Functional Theory} %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We can extend our density functional theory to a dynamical model using
techniques from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. We begin by considering
some non-equilibrium probability distribution over phase space, $f(\q, \p, t)$,
and its equation of motion,
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{liouville}
    \f{\partial f(\q, \p, t)}{\partial t} = -\l\lbrace f, \mathcal{H} \r\rbrace.
\end{equation}
%
Where, $\l\lbrace \cdot, \cdot \r\rbrace$, denotes the Poisson bracket,
%
\begin{equation}
    \l\lbrace f, g \r\rbrace = \sum_{i = 0}^N \f{\partial f}{\partial q_i}
        \f{\partial g}{\partial p_i} - \f{\partial g}{\partial q_i}
        \f{\partial g}{\partial p_i}.
\end{equation}
%
Equation \ref{liouville} is called the \textit{Liouville Equation}. Under
appropriate conditions the probability distribution will decay to the
equilibrium fixed point,
%
\begin{equation}
    \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} f(\q, \p, t) = f_{eq}(\q, \p)
\end{equation}
%

Using the non-equilibrium probability distribution, we can also discuss
non-equilibrium averages of the density profile and their associated equations
of motions. The non-equilibrium density is written in analogy with equation
\ref{mean_density},
%
\begin{equation}
    \rho(x, t) = \mean{\hat{\rho}(x; \q)}_{ne} =
        \trace{\hat{\rho}(x; \q) f(\q, \p, t)}.
\end{equation}
%
Where, $\mean{\cdot}_{ne}$, denotes the non-equilibrium average. Thusly, just
as the non-equilibrium probability distribution is driven to equilibrium by the
Liouville Equation, so too will the denisty profile by its own equation of
motion. Under the approximation that direct correlation function decays to
equilibrium more quickly more quickly than the density profile we can write the
equation of motion as[{\color{ForestGreen} Cite Evans and Tarazona here and
Archer for the distinction between these two equations? Perhaps Espanol as well
for the projection operator derivation}],
%
\begin{equation}
    \f{\partial \rho(x, t)}{\partial t} = 
        \nabla \cdot \l[
            D_0 \rho(x, t) \nabla \l(\f{\d \F[\rho]}{\d \rho(x, t)}\r)
        \r]
\end{equation}
%
Or, equivalently, we may write and equation of motion for the operator itself,
$\hat{\rho}$, as,
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{dens_langevin}
    \f{\partial \hat{\rho}(x, t)}{\partial t} =
        \nabla \cdot \l[
            D_0 \hat{\rho}(x, t) \nabla \l(\f{\d \F[\hat{\rho}]}{\d \hat{\rho}}\r)
        \r] + \xi(x, t).
\end{equation}
%
Where, $\mathbf{\xi}(x, t)$ is a Gaussian random driving force with zero
average and variance is,
%
\begin{equation}
    \mean{\xi(x, t)\xi(x^\prime, t^\prime)} = -2 \nabla \cdot \l[ D_0 \rho(x,t) 
        \nabla \d(x - x^\prime) \d(t - t^\prime)
    \r],
\end{equation}
%
Due to a generalized Einstein relation\footnote{See Appendix \ref{noise} for
details on generalized Einstein relations for nonlinear Langevin equations} for
the Langevin equation in equation \ref{dens_langevin}.

Equations similar to those seen here and extensions there of fall under the
category of \textit{Dynamic Density Functional Theory}(DDFT).
