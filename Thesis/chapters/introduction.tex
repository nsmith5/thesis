This thesis is divided into 6 chapters:
%
\begin{description}
    \item [Chapter \ref{chapter:cdft_intro}] { Classical Density Functional
        Theory (CDFT) is introduced and derived from fundamental principles of
        quantum statistical mechanics.
    }
    \item [Chapter \ref{chapter:cdft_of_freezing}] { CDFT theory of
        solidification is described and discussed. The density functional
        theory is extended to a dynamic, non-equilibrium theory and the Phase
        Field Crystal (PFC) Theory is introduced as a simplified density
        functional theory.
    }
    \item [Chapter \ref{chapter:binary}] { Binary PFC theory is established and
        previous simplified models are summarized and discussed.
    }
    \item [Chapter \ref{chapter:improvements}] { Improvements to the XPFC model
        are discussed and contains novel contribution to the field.
    }
    \item [Chapter \ref{chapter:applications}] { Concludes the thesis by
        applying the improved XPFC model to the problem of multistep nucleation
        of nanoparticles and discusses potential future applications.
    }
