\label{chapter:applications}

In this chapter we discuss applications of the improved binary XPFC
model \nc{introduced in Chapter \ref{binarychapter} to an application in 
microstructure evolution.  We first begin with, we introduce  a 
phenomenological set of equations of motion that describe solute 
and density diffusion in the binary XPFC model. We then apply these 
 to the examination of the process of diffusion limited 
precipitation from solution.}  Recent experimental work on the precipitation of
gold and silver nanoparticles\cite{LOH17} and on the precipitation of calcium
carbonate \cite{WALLACE13} has demonstrated that the pathway to nucleation can
deviate highly from the approximations of Classical Nucleation Theory (CNT). \nc{Specifically,
both experiments observe spinodal decomposition of the solution prior to
nucleation in the solute rich phase. In this chapter, we'll present early findings 
from our new model that lend support for this dynamical behaviour} and, additionally, show that the 
growth behaviour post-nucleation may be more complex than usual diffusive growth 
and coarsening typically observed. To conclude we discuss future applications both in the
study of precipitation and other areas.

\subsection{XPFC Dynamics} %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To examine applications of our improvements to the XPFC model we begin by
considering equations of motion. Following \cite{GREENWOOD11_BINARY}, we use
conservative dynamics for both $n(x, t)$ and $c(x, t)$.
%
\begin{gather}
    \f{\partial n(x, t)}{\partial t} = 
        M_n \nabla^2\l(\f{\d \beta \Delta\F / \rho_0}{\d n(x, t)}\r) 
        + \xi_n(x, t), \\ 
    \f{\partial c(x, t)}{\partial t} = 
        M_c \nabla^2\l(\f{\d \beta \Delta \F / \rho_0}{\d c(x, t)}\r)
        + \xi_c(x, t),
\end{gather}
%
\nc{where $M_n$ and $M_c$ are the solute and density mobilities. The noise terms $\xi_n(x, t)$ and $\xi_c(x, t)$ model thermal fluctuations. Their dynamics follow the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, the theory of which is derived in the Appendix \ref{noiseappendix}.} These equations of motion are largely phenomenological as, strictly speaking,
there is no reason that the local concentration should be conserved.  This
conservation can be justified in the limit that the total density does not
deviate far from the reference. When this is the case we have $c \equiv \B /
\rho \approx \B / \rho_0$ which \textit{is} conserved. \nc{For simplicity, we will carry 
out simulations in this chapter in this limit.}

\section{Multi-Step Nucleation of Nanoparticles in Solution} %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Supply some background on the problem and motivation

\nc{Many nanoparticle solutions are formed
by precipitation from solution and their size distribution (polydispersity
index) is of key importance to their application. Therefore, a precise
understanding of the kinetic pathway of precipitation is of crucial importance
in designing synthesis techniques of highly mono-disperse nanoparticles.

As stated above, recent experimental work has shown that precipitation from a
solution can follow a pathway vary different from that assumed by Classical
Nucleation Theory (CNT)\cite{LOH17, WALLACE13}. CNT assumes that, for binary
systems, changes in composition occur simultaneously to changes in order. In
contrast, these experimental findings show \nb{show or suggest?} that in certain 
systems changes in composition can precede changes in order via spinodal 
decomposition. While there is some dispute about whether or not to call this process a
non-classical \textit{nucleation} pathway \cite{DAVEY13, GEBAUER11}, the
observed pathway to precipitation raises several questions about its classification, 
regardless of semantics. }

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Classical and Non-classical Nucleation Theories} %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Discuss classical nucleation theory

In CNT, the rate of formation of post-critical can be written as an Arrhenius
equation,
%
\begin{equation}
    J = \f{\partial n^*}{\partial t} = A e^{-\beta\Delta G^{\ddagger}},
\end{equation}
where,
\begin{description}[labelwidth=1cm, align=right]
    \item[$A$] is a constant prefactor,
    \item[$\Delta G^\ddagger$] is the Gibbs free energy of a critical nucleus
    and, 
    \item[$n^*$] is the number if critical nuclei.
\end{description}
% 
Following \cite{MYERSON04}, the probability \nc{of nucleation of a droplet of volume
$V$, $f_{nuc}(t)$, is then,}
%
\begin{equation}
    f_{nuc}(t) = \mean{\f{N_{liq}}{N_{total}}} = e^{-J V t},
\end{equation}
\nc{where $N_{liq}$ and $N_{total}$ are ...} \nb{define these. Also, I thought it was $1-exp(-JVt)$?}

% Discuss non-classical nucleation theory and the methods of reaction co-ordinates

CNT assumes that there is a single critical state which is specified by the
thermodynamic parameters of the target phase at a critical radius $R^*$. This
naive approach dramatically underestimate the time required to assemble a
critical nucleus due to its simplistic parametrization of the kinetic pathway
\cite{LUTSKO15, MYERSON04, MYERSON09}.

Improvements to CNT can be made to the model by increasing the parameter space \nc{describing the nucleation process}.
Considering both radius and density of the critical nucleus \cite{LUTSKO15} gives good agreement with
nucleation of globular proteins, for example. One problem with this approach is
the selection of appropriate parameters. There is no guarantee that a finite
set parameters will describe the kinetic pathway taken by a nucleus and if we
are without a fundamental technique for calculating the chosen parameters we
have little way of knowing if our theory is accurate or simply over-fit. In
\cite{MYERSON09}, for example, nucleation data is fit to the functional form
instead of using calculated or otherwise measured parameters.

% Posit that field theory present an unbiased (un-parameterized) approach to nucleation

Statistical field theories such as the XPFC alloy model can help provide an
answer to this problem by taking an unbiased approach to nucleation process
within the context of CDFT.  The critical state, and entire kinetic pathway,
can be examined free of any particular parametrization. The equations of motion
can be integrated numerically for an ensemble systems and nucleation details
measured from the computed results.  Moreover, unlike other numerical
approaches to nucleation like molecular dynamics or formal density functional
theory, the PFC model can examine nucleation on diffusive time scales.

\subsection{XPFC Modelling of Precipitation} %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Motivate a submerged spinodal phase diagram

To construct an appropriate free energy functional for a system analogous to 
\nb{name the/an experimental system} we consider
the structure of its equilibrium phase diagram. Precipitation is indicative of
a simple liquid-solid coexistance curve. The \nc{presumed presence} of spinodal decomposition
under certain circumstances indicates that is a metastable liquid spinodal
submerged beneath the liquid-solid coexistance curve \cite{DAVEY13}. We assume
that there must exist conditions under which the spinodal decomposition of the
metastable liquid phase occurs more rapidly than nucleation directly from
solution (ie., classical nucleation).

% Discuss the implementation of this phase diagram using our improvements

Producing a phase diagram in our XPFC model with these characteristics is very similar to
modelling a monotectic system with the exception that the spinodal temperature
$T_c$ must be low enough to hide the entire liquid spinodal below the
coexistance curve.  We will also centre the interpolation function \nc{$\zeta_\alpha(c)$} 
\nb{shouldn't it be $\zeta_\alpha$ to be consistent with the previous notation?}
about \nc{$c = 1$ so that the nanocrystalline solid $\alpha$ is favoured at large concentration.} 
The resulting density-density correlation function for a 2 dimensional hexagonal 
precipitate would thus be,
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:precip_corr}
    \tilde{C}_{nn}(k; c) = \exp\l\lbrace - \f{(c - 1)^2}{2\sigma_c^2}\r\rbrace
        \exp\l\lbrace \f{T}{T_0} \r\rbrace 
        \exp\l\lbrace - \f{(k - k_{10})^2}{2\sigma^2} \r\rbrace,
\end{equation}
%
where,
\begin{description}[labelwidth=1cm, align=right]
    \item[$\sigma_c$] is the width of the interpolation function \nc{$\zeta_\alpha(c)$,}
        which controls the solvent solubility in the precipitate in this case
        and,
    \item[$k_{10}$] is the length of the [10] reciprocal lattice vector of the
        preciptate in equilibrium.
\end{description}

An example \nc{phase diagram of a system with sample parameters in equation \ref{eq:precip_corr} 
is shown} in figure \ref{fig:precip_phase_dia}. The metastable binodal (coexistence) and spinodal
curves are depicted below the coexistence curve.

        \ref{eq:precip_corr} are $\sigma = 0.8$, $k_{10} = 2\pi$, $T_0 = 1$
        and $\sigma_c = 0.5$.

\subsection{Dynamics of Precipitation: Results and Discussion} %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Describe with supporting figures the typical path way of precipitation.
 
\nc{We examined the precipitation process in a system that follows the XPFC model with 
corresponding equilibrium phase diagram in figure \ref{fig:precip_phase_dia}. The 
situation examined corresponded to a quench to a temperature below} the metastable spinodal 
curve. The spinodal curve marks an inflection point in the liquid free energy meaning the 
metastable liquid becomes fully unstable and decomposes into regions of differing concentration 
as a result. \nc{A typical microstructure evolution sequence results for a typical quench of a uniform solution
of $c = 0.3$ from the liquid phase to a temperature $T/T_0 = 0.07$ is shown in figure \ref{fig:precipitation}}. 
\nc{Frames (a)-(c) show the initial decmposition of the liquid, once below the spinodal temperature, 
into two regions of high and low compositions. Frames (d)-(f) show that once the concentration in the solute-rich regions of the decomposed liquid occurs, nucleation of the solid phase begins to occur in these confined liquid volumes. Once nucleated, the solid regions start/continue to grow at the expense of the liquid phase. Finally, in frames (g)-(i), the nucleated nanoparticles undergo growth and coarsening. This simulation is a typical example where the nucleation of precipitates in preceded by spinodal decomposition, which is consistent with the  the experimental findings mentioned above for the \nb{X-Y}system. While one simulation sequence is show here, this scenario was typical of all ensembles we ran and from which we gathered statistics for the data shown below. As mentioned above, we observed that once any solute-rich regions crystallize, their growth is
accelerated at the expense of uncrystallized solute-rich regions. We refer to this phenomena as \textit{sacrificial growth} (frames (d)-(f) in figure \ref{fig:precipitation})).}

% Discuss the growth picture (hyper / hypo diffusive)
%
To quantify the phenomena shown in figure \ref{fig:precipitation}, \nc{we examine the mean radius $\mean{R(t)}$ of
solute-rich domains as a function of time, and average the results over an ensemble of 120 quenches}. Here we define the mean radius as the square root of the mean area,
%
\begin{equation}
    \mean{R(t)} = \sqrt{\mean{A(t)}}.
\end{equation}
%
\nc{The results obtained are not expected to depend on the precise definition of $R(t)$.} 

In purely diffusive growth the mean radius should scale as $\mean{R(t)} \sim
t^{1/2}$, while at the late steged of growth, where coarsening occurs, the growth rate is 
expected to follow  $\mean{R(t)} \sim t^{1/3}$ dynamics. 
In figure \ref{fig:scaling} we plot $\langle R(t)\rangle $ \nc{on a log-log graph}. 
lines corresponding to the diffusive growth exponent are also drawn for comparison to numerical results.
The data shows that for early times, crystalline regions grow at a hyper-diffusive rate. 
%

\end{figure}
\noindent This decays to hypo-diffusive after uncrystallized regions have disappeared and coarsening takes over the kinetics of precipitation.
% Discuss the nucleation picture (fraction of uncrystallized droplets)
% and compare with MYERSON for example

During sacrificial growth period referred to above, we observe that nucleation is suppressed in the remaining
uncrystallized solute-rich regions. When both crystallized and uncrystallized
solute-rich regions exist, solute is segregated into crystallized regions
because of the difference in chemical potential. Constricted by surface tension
and deprived of solute, these remaining droplets have a far slower nucleation
rate \nc{(thermodynamic driving force)} than when no crystallized regions exist. This can be seen more
quantitatively by examining the fraction of uncrystallized droplets versus time. \nc{This is
shown in figure \ref{fig:incubation} for the case corresponding to the data in 
figure \ref{fig:precipitation} in}. At $\sim 50\%$ crystallization, we see a
pronounced reduction in the nucleation rate as the diffusive process of
sacrificial growth dominates, \nc{consistent with our expected hypothesis above.}

\section{Outlook and Future Applications} %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Explore the remainder of the phase space of nucleation
% Is CNT valid on some regime?
% Is the turnbull model valid elsewhere?

\nc{The results presented here describe the behaviour of a quench followed by multi-step precipitation process of relevance to the precipitation of gold nano-particles observed in recent experiments. The is noteworthy that the predicted results were done within a single framework and set parameters corresponding to the improved XPFC alloy 
model introduced in this thesis. The dynamical results shown here} point to a richness in 
the landscape of kinetic pathways to precipitation. One direction for future application of the improved XPFC framework is to explore more of this landscape and to determine the effect of quench parameter and solution concentration in nucleation kinetics, as well as the  polydispersity of precipitated particles, key features of interest to experimental investigations of this topic.

% List other applications (stability of nanocrystalline alloys is the top of my
% list)

Beyond the study of precipitation there are other processes in which our improvements
to the XPFC alloy model may prove insightful. \nc{Investigating the effects of elasticity on 
monotectic and  syntectic nucleation and growth are one clear direction that can now 
be studied given the capacity} to model the equilibrium phase diagrams and kinetics 
of these materials. As previously noted, the problem of stability of nanocrystalline binary 
alloys is another topic of importance that has  been shown to depend on the enthalpy 
of mixing of the system \cite{MURDOCH13}.
