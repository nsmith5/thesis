{
    \color{ForestGreen} Here we discuss what the idea of 'applications' being
    an examination of dynamical phenomena in materials.....
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Dynamics in the small $\Delta n$ limit} %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

{
    \color{ForestGreen} Develop the dynamics from DDFT and show (with references
    to the relevant papers that these dynamics are valid in the small density
    change limit specifically
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Multistep Nucleation of Nanoparticles in Solution} %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

{
    \color{ForestGreen} Discuss the interest in this process with reference to 
    papers about multistep nucleation theories. Discuss relevance of nanoparticles
    size and prediction of size (catalyzsis, color, etc... size is the basic relevant
    detail of nanoparticles).
