\label{chapter:applications}

In this chapter we discuss applications of our improvements to the binary XPFC
model.  To begin we'll discuss a phenomenological equation of motion for the
binary XPFC system. Next we'll examine the process of diffusion limited
precipitation from solution.  Recent experimental work on the precipitation of
gold and silver nanoparticles\cite{LOH17} and on the precipitation of calcium
carbonate \cite{WALLACE13} has demonstrated that pathway to nucleation can
deviate highly from the approximations of Classical Nucleation Theory (CNT).
Both experiments observe spinodal decomposition of the solution prior to
nucleation in the solute rich phase. We'll present early findings that
reproduce this behaviour and additionally show that the growth behaviour post
nucleation may be more complex than usual diffusive growth and coarsening
typically observed. To conclude we discuss future applications both in the
study of precipitation and other areas.

\subsection{Dynamics} %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To examine applications of our improvements to the XPFC model we begin by
considering equations of motion. Following \cite{GREENWOOD11_BINARY}, we use
conservative dynamics for both $n(x, t)$ and $c(x, t)$.
%
\begin{gather}
    \f{\partial n(x, t)}{\partial t} = 
        M_n \nabla^2\l(\f{\d \beta \Delta\F / \rho_0}{\d n(x, t)}\r) 
        + \xi_n(x, t), \\ 
    \f{\partial c(x, t)}{\partial t} = 
        M_c \nabla^2\l(\f{\d \beta \Delta \F / \rho_0}{\d c(x, t)}\r)
        + \xi_c(x, t).
\end{gather}
%
These equations of motion are largely phenomenological as, strictly speaking,
there is no reason that the local concentration should be conserved.  This
conservation can be justified in the limit that the total density does not
deviate far from the reference. When this is the case we have $c \equiv \B /
\rho \approx \B / \rho_0$ which \textit{is} conserved.

\subsection{Modelling Precipitation} %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Motivate a submerged spinodal phase diagram

To construct an appropriate free energy functional for this system we consider
the structure of its equilibrium phase diagram. Precipitation is indicative of
a simple liquid-solid coexistance curve. The presence of spinodal decomposition
under certain circumstances indicates that is a metastable liquid spinodal
submerged beneath the liquid-solid coexistance curve \cite{DAVEY13}. We assume
that there must exist conditions under which the spinodal decomposition of the
metastable liquid phase occurs more rapidly than nucleation directly from
solution (ie., classical nucleation).

% Discuss the implementation of this phase diagram using our improvements

Producing a phase diagram with these characteristics is very similar to
modelling a monotectic system with the exception that the spinodal temperature
$T_c$ must be low enough to hide the entire liquid spinodal below the
coexistance curve.  We will also centre the interpolation function $\zeta_c$
about the $c = 1$ point so that the concentration is interpreted as the solute
concentration. The resulting density-density correlation function for a 2
dimensional hexagonal precipitate would be,
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:precip_corr}
    \tilde{C}_{nn}(k; c) = \exp\l\lbrace - \f{(c - 1)^2}{2\sigma_c^2}\r\rbrace
        \exp\l\lbrace \f{T}{T_0} \r\rbrace 
        \exp\l\lbrace - \f{(k - k_{10})^2}{2\sigma^2} \r\rbrace,
\end{equation}
%
Where,
\begin{description}[labelwidth=1cm, align=right]
    \item[$\sigma_c$] is the width of the interpolation function $\zeta(c)$
        which controls the solvent solubility in the precipitate in this case
        and,
    \item[$k_{10}$] is the length of the [10] reciprocal lattice vector of the
        preciptate in equilibrium.
\end{description}

An example of a system with appropriate parameters can be seen in figure
\ref{fig:precip_phase_dia}. The metastable binodal (coexistance) and spinodal
curves are depicted below the coexistance curve.

% Describe with supporting figures the typical path way of precipitation.

Using the system with phase diagram depicted in figure
\ref{fig:precip_phase_dia}, we examine the precipitation process under a quench
the passes the metastable spinodal curve. The spinodal curve marks an inflection
point in the liquid free energy meaning the metastable liquid becomes fully
unstable and decomposes as a result. A typical quench from a uniform solution
of $c = 0.3$ to $T = 0.07$ is depicted in figure \ref{fig:precipitation}. We
can clearly see that nucleation is preceded by spinodal decomposition as in
experimental the experimental findings.

%
We also see that once any solute-rich regions crystallize, their growth is
accelerated at the expense of uncrystallized solute-rich regions. We call this
phenomena \textit{sacrificial growth}. 
%
% Discuss the growth picture (hyper / hypo diffusive)
%
To quantify this phenomena we examine the mean radius $\mean{R(t)}$ of
solute-rich domains in time of an ensemble of 120 quenches. Here we define the
mean radius as the square root of the mean area,
%
\begin{equation}
    \mean{R(t)} = \sqrt{\mean{A(t)}}.
\end{equation}
%
In purely diffusive growth the mean radius should scale as $\mean{R(t)} \sim
t^{1/2}$ and coarsen (the very late stages of growth) as $\mean{R(t)} \sim
t^{1/3}$. In figure \ref{fig:scaling} we plot the growth exponents in time on a
log-log plot with diffusive growth marked in black for reference. Indeed for
early crystalline regions we see hyper-diffusive growth which decays to
hypo-diffusive after uncrystallized regions have disappeared.

\end{figure}

% Discuss the nucleation picture (fraction of uncrystallized droplets)
% and compare with MYERSON for example

During sacrificial growth we see that nucleation is suppressed in the remaining
uncrystallized solute-rich regions. When both crystallized and uncrystallized
solute-rich regions exist, solute is segregated into crystallized regions
because of the difference in chemical potential. Constricted by surface tension
and deprived of solute, these remaining droplets have a far slower nucleation
rate than when no crystallized regions exist. This can be seen more
quantitatively by examining the fraction of uncrystallized droplets in time as
in figure \ref{fig:incubation}. At $\sim 50\%$ crystallization we see a
pronounced reduction in the nucleation rate as the diffusive process of
sacrificial growth dominates.

Recent experimental work has shown that precipitation of nanoparticles solution
can follow a pathway vary different from that assumed by Classical Nucleation
Theory (CNT).  In gold and silver nanoparticles\cite{LOH17} as well as calcium
carbonate (CaCO${}_3$)\cite{WALLACE13} systems precipitation occurs first via
spinodal decomposition of the aqueous solution followed by nucleation inside
the resulting solute-rich liquid droplets. CNT assumes that, for binary
systems, assumes that changes in order and composition occur simultaneously.
While there is some dispute about whether or not to call this process a
non-classical nucleation pathway \cite{DAVEY13, GEBAUER11}, the observed pathway
to precipitation raises several questions regardless of semantics about its
classification. Under what conditions does this pathway occur? How does the 
pathway effect the polydispersity of the final nanoparticle? We present here
initial finding using the improved binary XPFC formalism.

These experimental findings are among many works that point to a deficiency in
CNT. Common among these works is the presence of a multi-step nucleation
process. While some theoretical description exist for these multi-step
processes, they typically posit highly simplified pathways to nucleation for
simplicity of analysis that may be far from the actual kinetics experienced by
the system.  For instance in the study of condensation of a pure material,
Lutsko \textit{et al.} \cite{LUTSKO15} restricted the nucleus to a spherical
droplet with radius $R$ and density $\rho$. Thus restricted, they find that the
most likely path to nucleation follows a three-stage pathway.  These theories
can justify a multi-step nucleation pathway but do little more to advance our
knowledge of the \textit{actual} pathway to nucleation.

It is important, then, to have robust models that contain all of the essential
physics of these systems to gain a deeper insight into the phenomena. The works
of Loh \cite{LOH17} are a special case of diffusion limited precipitation because
their system was a 30nm thick aqueous solution. The effective diffusion
constant in this thin water film is 9 orders of magnitude smaller than in the
bulk and as such the system is diffusion limited. To model this process we must
be able to  model changes in composition, structure and density. A negative
enthalpy of mixing is clearly playing in important role so our improved XPFC
model is a good fit.

To construct an appropriate free energy functional for this system we consider
the structure of its equilibrium phase diagram. Precipitation is indicative of
a simple liquid-solid coexistance curve beneath which we assume there also a
submerged metastable liquid spinodal \cite{DAVEY13}. Producing a system with
these characteristics is similar to that of a monotectic with the exception
that the spinodal temperature, $T_c$, must now be sufficiently low to hide
below the coexistance curve. We will also also use a Gaussian window function
$\zeta(c)$ as the in the monotectic case though this time centring the Gaussian
about $c = 1$ in keeping with interpreting the concentration as a solute
concentration.  An example, including depiction of the metastable spinodal, can
be seen in figure \ref{fig:precip_phase_dia}.

    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{solution.eps}
    \caption[Coexistance Phase Diagram with Metastable Spinodal]{
        \label{fig:precip_phase_dia} Phase Diagram of a Precipitating Solution
        with hexagonal $\alpha$ phase. The free energy parameters are $\eta =
        2$, $\chi = 1$, $\omega=0.3$, $\epsilon_0=30$, $T_c = 0.15$ and
        $c_0=0.5$. The parameters for the base correlation function are
        $\sigma_{10\alpha} = 0.8$, $k_{10\alpha} = 2\pi$, and $T\_0 = 1$ and
        the parameters for the interpolation function are $\sigma_c = 0.5$.
    }
\end{figure}

We would expect that, starting from a uniform initial condition, if we quench
the system through the coexistance region and past the liquid spinodal we might
see a nucleation pathway similar to that observed experimentally. Results of a
numerical simulation \footnote{See appendix \ref{appendix:algorithm} for a
detailed description of the integration algorithm} can be seen in figure
\ref{fig:precipitation}. We see that, much as in experimental observation,
nanoparticle nucleation is preceded by spinodal decomposition.


Our model finds some addition complexity in the nucleation process as well.
Once crystalline nuclei start to form, they growth is accelerated at the
expense of the solute-rich liquid droplets in solution. In a system of coarsen
droplets with only a single phase, larger droplets grow at the expense of
smaller droplets to reduce the total surface tension in the system. This
process is called Oswald ripening. In the nanoparticle system even smaller
crystalline particles can grow at the expense of larger liquid droplets due to
their difference in chemical potential.


We can examine this growth phenomena more systematically by measuring the
ensemble average droplet radius $\langle R(t) \rangle$ over time. We achieve
this by running 120 simulations with the same parameters as the quench
described in figure \ref{fig:precipitation} and computing the radius of all
droplets and their phase (liquid or solid) throughout the simulation. Strictly
diffusive growth scales like $\mean{R(t)} \sim t^{1/2}$ and so in plotting the
mean radius versus time on a log-log plot as in figure \ref{fig:scaling} we see
how the growth of solid and liquid droplets compare to diffusive growth. Early
solid droplets grow at a weakly hyper-diffusive rate due to the presence of
the sacrificial liquid droplets and slow to sub-diffusive as they begin to
coarsen.


A more pronounced view of this phenomena can be seen by examining the fraction
of uncrystallized droplets in the system with respect to time as in figure
\ref{fig:incubation}. Neither classical nor proposed non-classical nucleation
theories explain the pronounced reduction in nucleation rate seen once the
fraction of solid droplets reachs approximately one half. Instead of developing
via nucleation in the remaining droplets we see liquid droplet anhilation
beginning to become an important driving factor in increasing the solid
fraction. As liquid droplets shrink the nucleation rate inside the droplet is
suppressed by solute and density segregation to solid droplets. In classical
nucleation theory we would expect an exponential decay and even in proposed
two-step mechanisms do not account for these solid-liquid droplet
effects\cite{MYERSON04, MYERSON09}.
