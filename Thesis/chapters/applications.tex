\label{chapter:applications}

In this chapter we discuss applications of our improvements to the binary XPFC
model.  To begin we'll discuss a phenomenological equation of motion for the
binary XPFC system. Next we'll examine the process of diffusion limited
precipitation from solution.  Recent experimental work on the precipitation of
gold and silver nanoparticles\cite{LOH17} and on the precipitation of calcium
carbonate \cite{WALLACE13} has demonstrated that pathway to nucleation can
deviate highly from the approximations of Classical Nucleation Theory (CNT).
Both experiments observe spinodal decomposition of the solution prior to
nucleation in the solute rich phase. We'll present early findings that
reproduce this behaviour and additionally show that the growth behaviour post
nucleation may be more complex than usual diffusive growth and coarsening
typically observed. To conclude we discuss future applications both in the
study of precipitation and other areas.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Dynamics} %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To examine applications of our improvements to the XPFC model we begin by
considering equations of motion. Following \cite{GREENWOOD11_BINARY}, we use
conservative dynamics for both $n(x, t)$ and $c(x, t)$.
%
\begin{gather}
    \f{\partial n(x, t)}{\partial t} = 
        M_n \nabla^2\l(\f{\d \beta \Delta\F / \rho_0}{\d n(x, t)}\r) 
        + \xi_n(x, t), \\ 
    \f{\partial c(x, t)}{\partial t} = 
        M_c \nabla^2\l(\f{\d \beta \Delta \F / \rho_0}{\d c(x, t)}\r)
        + \xi_c(x, t).
\end{gather}
%
These equations of motion are largely phenomenological as, strictly speaking,
there is no reason that the local concentration should be conserved.  This
conservation can be justified in the limit that the total density does not
deviate far from the reference. When this is the case we have $c \equiv \B /
\rho \approx \B / \rho_0$ which \textit{is} conserved.

\section{Multi-step Nucleation of Nanoparticles in Solution} %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Supply some background on the problem and motivation

As stated previously, recent experimental work has shown that precipitation
solution can follow a pathway vary different from that assumed by Classical
Nucleation Theory (CNT)\cite{LOH17, WALLACE13}. CNT assumes that, for binary
systems, assumes that changes in order and composition occur simultaneously. In
contrast, these findings show that in certain systems changes in composition
can precede changes in order via spinodal decomposition.

While there is some dispute about whether or not to call this process a
non-classical \textit{nucleation} pathway \cite{DAVEY13, GEBAUER11}, the
observed pathway to precipitation raises several questions regardless of
semantics about its classification. Many nanoparticle solutions are formed
by precipitation from solution and their size distribution (polydispersity
index) is of key importance to their application. Therefore, a precise
understanding of the kinetic pathway of precipitation is of crucial importance
in designing synthesis techniques of highly mono-disperse nanoparticles.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Classical and Non-classical Nucleation Theories} %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Discuss classical nucleation theory

In CNT, the rate of formation of post-critical can be written as an Arrhenius
equation,
%
\begin{equation}
    J = \f{\partial n^*}{\partial t} = A e^{-\beta\Delta G^{\ddagger}},
\end{equation}
Where,
\begin{description}[labelwidth=1cm, align=right]
    \item[$A$] is a constant prefactor,
    \item[$\Delta G^\ddagger$] is the Gibbs free energy of a critical nucleus
    and, 
    \item[$n^*$] is the number if critical nuclei.
\end{description}
% 
Following \cite{MYERSON04}, the probability of nucleation in droplet of volume
$V$ is then,
%
\begin{equation}
    f_{nuc}(t) = \mean{\f{N_{liq}}{N_{total}}} = e^{-J V t}.
\end{equation}

% Discuss non-classical nucleation theory and the methods of reaction co-ordinates

CNT assumes that there is a single critical state which is specified by the
thermodynamic parameters of the target phase at a critical radius $R^*$. This
naive approach dramatically underestimate the time required to assemble a
critical nucleus due to its simplistic parametrization of the kinetic pathway
\cite{LUTSKO15, MYERSON04, MYERSON09}.

Improvements can be made to the model by increasing the parameter space.
Considering radius and density \cite{LUTSKO15} gives good agreement with
nucleation of globular proteins, for example. One problem with this approach is
the selection of appropriate parameters. There is no guarantee that a finite
set parameters will describe the kinetic pathway taken by a nucleus and if we
are without a fundamental technique for calculating the chosen parameters we
have little way of knowing if our theory is accurate or simply over-fit. In
\cite{MYERSON09}, for example, nucleation data is fit to the functional form
instead of using calculated or otherwise measured parameters.

% Posit that field theory present an unbiased (un-parameterized) approach to nucleation

Statistical field theories such as the XPFC model provide an answer to this
problem by taking a unbiased approach to nucleation. The critical state, and
entire kinetic pathway, can be examined with any parametrization. The equations
of motion can be integrated numerically for an ensemble systems and nucleation
details measured from the results. Unlike other numerical approaches to
nucleation like molecular dynamics or density functional theory the PFC model
can examine nucleation on diffusive time scales.

\subsection{Modelling Precipitation} %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Motivate a submerged spinodal phase diagram

To construct an appropriate free energy functional for this system we consider
the structure of its equilibrium phase diagram. Precipitation is indicative of
a simple liquid-solid coexistance curve. The presence of spinodal decomposition
under certain circumstances indicates that is a metastable liquid spinodal
submerged beneath the liquid-solid coexistance curve \cite{DAVEY13}. We assume
that there must exist conditions under which the spinodal decomposition of the
metastable liquid phase occurs more rapidly than nucleation directly from
solution (ie., classical nucleation).

% Discuss the implementation of this phase diagram using our improvements

Producing a phase diagram with these characteristics is very similar to
modelling a monotectic system with the exception that the spinodal temperature
$T_c$ must be low enough to hide the entire liquid spinodal below the
coexistance curve.  We will also centre the interpolation function $\zeta_c$
about the $c = 1$ point so that the concentration is interpreted as the solute
concentration. The resulting density-density correlation function for a 2
dimensional hexagonal precipitate would be,
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:precip_corr}
    \tilde{C}_{nn}(k; c) = \exp\l\lbrace - \f{(c - 1)^2}{2\sigma_c^2}\r\rbrace
        \exp\l\lbrace \f{T}{T_0} \r\rbrace 
        \exp\l\lbrace - \f{(k - k_{10})^2}{2\sigma^2} \r\rbrace,
\end{equation}
%
Where,
\begin{description}[labelwidth=1cm, align=right]
    \item[$\sigma_c$] is the width of the interpolation function $\zeta(c)$
        which controls the solvent solubility in the precipitate in this case
        and,
    \item[$k_{10}$] is the length of the [10] reciprocal lattice vector of the
        preciptate in equilibrium.
\end{description}

An example of a system with appropriate parameters can be seen in figure
\ref{fig:precip_phase_dia}. The metastable binodal (coexistance) and spinodal
curves are depicted below the coexistance curve.

        $c_0=0.5$. The parameters for the correlation function from equation
        \ref{eq:precip_corr} are $\sigma = 0.8$, $k_{10} = 2\pi$, $T\_0 = 1$

\subsection{Results and Discussion} %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Describe with supporting figures the typical path way of precipitation.

Using the system with phase diagram depicted in figure
\ref{fig:precip_phase_dia}, we examine the precipitation process under a quench
the passes the metastable spinodal curve. The spinodal curve marks an inflection
point in the liquid free energy meaning the metastable liquid becomes fully
unstable and decomposes as a result. A typical quench from a uniform solution
of $c = 0.3$ to $T = 0.07$ is depicted in figure \ref{fig:precipitation}. We
can clearly see that nucleation is preceded by spinodal decomposition as in
experimental the experimental findings.

        Various stages of precipitation of nanoparticles from solution. All
        thermodynamic parameters are shared with figure
        \ref{fig:precip_phase_dia}. The initial condition is a uniform solution
        quenched abruptly to $T$ = 0.07. The initial condition has
        concentration $c = 0.3$ and relative density $n = 0.05$. Mobilities
        $M_n$ and $M_c$ are set to 1 and $W_c$ is set to 3.0. Numerical
        parameters are grid spacing $\Delta x = 0.125$ on a 1024 by 1024
        lattice with time step size $\Delta t = 0.0025$. Sub-figures (a) - (c)
        show spinodal decomposition of the liquid into solute right and solute
        poor regions. Sub-figures (d) - (f) show nucleation of the solid and
        solid growth at the expense of liquid regions.  The remaining
        sub-figures show only nanoparticle growth and coarsening.
    }
\end{figure}
%
We also see that once any solute-rich regions crystallize, their growth is
accelerated at the expense of uncrystallized solute-rich regions. We call this
phenomena \textit{sacrificial growth}. 
%
% Discuss the growth picture (hyper / hypo diffusive)
%
To quantify this phenomena we examine the mean radius $\mean{R(t)}$ of
solute-rich domains in time of an ensemble of 120 quenches. Here we define the
mean radius as the square root of the mean area,
%
\begin{equation}
    \mean{R(t)} = \sqrt{\mean{A(t)}}.
\end{equation}
%
In purely diffusive growth the mean radius should scale as $\mean{R(t)} \sim
t^{1/2}$ and coarsen (the very late stages of growth) as $\mean{R(t)} \sim
t^{1/3}$. In figure \ref{fig:scaling} we plot the growth exponents in time on a
log-log plot with diffusive growth marked in black for reference. Indeed for
early crystalline regions we see hyper-diffusive growth which decays to
hypo-diffusive after uncrystallized regions have disappeared.

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{scaling}
    \caption{

        Droplet growth exponents
    }
\end{figure}

% Discuss the nucleation picture (fraction of uncrystallized droplets)
% and compare with MYERSON for example

During sacrificial growth we see that nucleation is suppressed in the remaining
uncrystallized solute-rich regions. When both crystallized and uncrystallized
solute-rich regions exist, solute is segregated into crystallized regions
because of the difference in chemical potential. Constricted by surface tension
and deprived of solute, these remaining droplets have a far slower nucleation
rate than when no crystallized regions exist. This can be seen more
quantitatively by examining the fraction of uncrystallized droplets in time as
in figure \ref{fig:incubation}. At $\sim 50\%$ crystallization we see a
pronounced reduction in the nucleation rate as the diffusive process of
sacrificial growth dominates.

\section{Future Applications and Conclusions} %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Explore the remainder of the phase space of nucleation
% Is CNT valid on some regime?
% Is the turnbull model valid elsewhere?

The works present here describe the behaviour of quench with a single set of
parameters, but they point to a richness in the landscape of kinetic pathways to
precipitation. One direction for future application of the improved XPFC framework
is to explore more of this landscape and to determine the effect of quench parameter
choice on nucleation kinetics and polydispersity.

% List other applications (stability of nanocrystalline alloys is the top of my
% list)

Beyond the study of precipitation there are other processes in which our improvements
to the XPFC model may prove insightful. The effects of elasticity on monotectic and 
syntectic nucleation and growth are one clear opportunity given our capacity to model
the equilibrium phase diagrams of these materials. As previously noted the problem
of stability of nanocrystalline binary alloys is another topic of importance that has 
been shown to depend on the enthaply of mixing of the system \cite{MURDOCH13}.
