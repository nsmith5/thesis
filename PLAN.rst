Goals for my PhD
================

This document is here to outline, in detail, the goals that I would like to accomplish during my PhD. Goals are split into major goals and the minor goals that make up the major goals. 


1.0 Demonstrate the Flexibility of the Binary XPFC model
=========================================================

The first major goal, and probably the simpliest is to demonstrate that with the new :math:`\epsilon(T)(c-c_0)^2/2` term in the free energy we should be able to produce all invariant reactions that a binary system can ever exhibit. The point here is not to dig into the intimate details of each of these reactions but to show, at a high level, that each one of them can be modelled.


1.1 The Syntectic Reaction :math:`l_1 + l_2 \rightarrow \alpha` 
---------------------------------------------------------------------

To demonstrate the syntectic reaction we must complete the following tasks:

- Construct a free energy with the appropriate properties
- Construct a phase diagram
