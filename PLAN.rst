Goals for my PhD
================

This document is here to outline, in detail, the goals that I would like to accomplish during my PhD. Goals are split into major goals and the minor goals that make up the major goals. 


1.0 Demonstrate the Flexibility of the Binary XPFC model
=========================================================

The first major goal, and probably the simpliest is to demonstrate that with the new :math:`\epsilon(T)(c-c_0)^2/2` term in the free energy we should be able to produce all invariant reactions that a binary system can ever exhibit. The point here is not to dig into the intimate details of each of these reactions but to show, at a high level, that each one of them can be modelled.


1.1 The Syntectic Reaction :math:`l_1 + l_2 \rightarrow \alpha` 
----------------------------------------------------------------

To demonstrate the syntectic reaction we must complete the following tasks:

- Construct a free energy with the appropriate properties
- Construct a phase diagram
- Demonstrate that the system numerically. 
- Show nucleation of the :math:`\alpha` phase in simulation

Note: The spinodal in the liquid is *not* accurate. The coarsening of such a system requires hydrodynamics to be accurately described

1.2 The Monotectic Reaction :math:`l_1 \righarrow l_1 + \alpha`
---------------------------------------------------------------- 

To demonstrate the monotectic reaction we must complete the following tasks:

- Construct a free energy with the appropriate properties
- Construct a phase diagram
- Demonstrate that the system numerically. 

1.3 The Eutectoid Reaction :math:`\gamma \rightarrow \alpha + \epsilon`
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To demonstrate the eutectoid reaction we must complete the following tasks:

- Construct a free energy with the appropriate properties
- Construct a phase diagram
- Demonstrate that the system numerically.
