@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="The definition of $\Delta C$ in the original binary PFC model was expressed in different variables than those used here. However, by expanding $\Delta c(r)$ here facilitates comparison with other theories"}

@FOOTNOTE{Note3,key="Note3",note="The original XPFC works used a phenomenological prefactor $e^{-\sigma ^2 / C}$, where $\sigma $ was considered a model temperature parameter and $C$ a constant. That choice was inspired by harmonic analysis in the solid phase and the Debye-Waller factor."}
